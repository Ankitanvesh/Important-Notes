response has a response.on function which means =>

response.on can take a few 'events' that happen during
 the response life cycle,

The two you have above are response.on('data'...) 
which is when you get the data and response.on('end'...) 
is at the end of the response, simple as that!

CoffeeScript is a programming language used to compile JavaScript
So the code written in CoffeeScript and is compiled output is in 
JavaScript. It is for writing less code and doing much more than 
regular JavaScript.

REST is an architectural style. Its a set of guidelines that
work well together and help build the architecture of your 
application. It defines a set of guidelines that can be used 
by the developers to create APIs. 

Protocol can be thought of as a language or a mechanism 
for communication

emmiter.emit('/*  */') emits event
emmiter.on('event','callback') or 
emiter.addlistener('event','callback') listens 
to event

response.pipe(/**/) it sends data from the 
stream which comes as dicrete stuff in such a 
way that the whole of the data is transmitted in 
one go

socket is the end point of communication just 
like the receiver in a telephone call

the listen function waits for the caller

To render a JSX expression means to make it 
appear onscreen.

ReactDOM is the name of a JavaScript library. This 
library contains several React-specific methods, 
all of which deal with the DOM in some way or another.

The first argument is appended to whatever element is selected by the second argument of ReactDOM() method i.e the second argument determines the placement(or rendering ) of the first argument.

API is an interface that allows one to connect with the application
that has provided the API. It refers to an endPoint which allows a 
programmer to access the application from the code using the endPoint.

In summary, here's what happens when you try to update
 the DOM in React:
The entire virtual DOM gets updated.
The virtual DOM gets compared to what it looked like
 before you updated it. React figures out which 
 objects have changed.
The changed objects, and the changed objects only, get updated on the real DOM.
Changes on the real DOM cause the screen to change.

Curly braces in JSX tags make the script behave as 
javascript instead of plain JSX(similar to html)(JSX is a preprocessor to insert xml syntax into the js)

Note that in HTML, event listener names are written 
in all lowercase, such as onclick or onmouseover.
 In JSX, event listener names are written in camelCase,
  such as onClick or onMouseOver.

You can not inject an if statement into a JSX expression.

whenever one encloses a tag inside parenthesis then 
even the interior stuff in the tag is treated
as javascript instead of jsx
eg: const img = <img src={pics[coinToss() == 'heads' ?  'kitty': 'doggy']} />;

todo : jus c what is hoisting in js

React events are named using camelCase, rather than 
lowercase.

With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, 
rather than a string.

If a JavaScript file contains JSX code, then that 
file will have to be compiled. That means that before 
the file reaches a web browser, a JSX compiler will 
translate any JSX into regular JavaScript.

in case u forget the significance of 'this' refer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV9sHLX-jZU

The reason for this is that in <Button /> is not an 
HTML-like JSX element; it's a component instance. i.e 
 <Button /> is an object of the component and not a 
 HTML tag.

Methods should never be comma-separated, if inside of
 a class body.

Due to the way that event handlers are bound in 
JavaScript, this.toggleMood() loses its this when
 it is used on line 20(a function defined as toggleMood).
Therefore, the expressions this.state.mood and 
this.setState on lines 7 and 8 (the occurance of lines 7 and lines 8 is only for refferal purpose and can be neglected) 
won't mean what they're supposed 
to... unless you have already bound the correct this to this.toggleMood.

Actually the bind used in the this.state object ensures that the this in the handleChange(or change handler)
function is a reference to the global this(the this of the class thats rendering html).

That is why we must bind this.toggleMood to this on line 8(only for depicting purposes).

 In React, whenever you define an event handler that uses this, you need to add this.methodName = this.methodName.bind(this) to your constructor function.

 The code in the component will not begin from render dont confuse it to be like int main function the component follows top-down approach.

 A component "mounts" when it renders for the first time. This is when mounting lifecycle methods get called.

Context is always the value of the this keyword which is a reference to the object that “owns” the currently executing code.

the command event.target.value fires the event on the target DOM element in that DOM's value attribute

bundle install must run in a directory which contains a GemFile 
Gemfile and bundler are a new introduction to ruby and hav been added 
so as to resolve a following issue :
   We used to reqiure the file that we wanted to use in a project
    which would byDefault install its latest version but  there are
    some aplications which reqiure a specific version which may or may
    not be the latest and there are many gems which need other gems 
    for their working there is a huge possibility that one gem say 
    devise may need a gem warden with version 1.2.1 and another gem 
    say rails needs warden to be at version 2.0.1 so in order to solve
     this conflict Gemfile and bundle were introduced so one can reqiure in a different way check video

In multitasking computer operating systems, a daemon is a computer program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user. Traditionally, 
the process names of a daemon end with the letter d, for clarification that the process is, in fact, a daemon, and for differentiation between a daemon and a normal computer program. For example,
syslogd is the daemon that implements the system logging facility, and sshd is a daemon that serves incoming SSH connections.

Markup languages are designed for the processing, definition and presentation of text. The language specifies code for formatting, both the layout and style, within a text file. The code used to 
specify the formatting are called tags. HTML is a an example of a widely known and used markup language.

Avoid the following practices on reducers :
 1. Mutate its arguments;

 2. Perform side effects like 
    API calls and routing transitions;

 3. Call non-pure functions, e.g. Date.now() 
    or Math.random().

A reducer must never return undefined.    

Whenever we import stuff with curly braces what we 
mean to do is to be able to use only that required 
function or object instead of the whole library which
contains that particular function or object.
eg:                 import {createStore} from 'redux'
is the same as    { import redux from 'redux'
                    let createStore = redux.createStore
                  }
    In both of the above cases createStore functions in the same way
    and is the exact same thing.

Rake is a multiPurpose tool for running scripts.

File/Folder	Purpose
app/	    Contains the controllers, models, views, helpers, mailers,
            channels, jobs and assets for your application. You'll 
            focus on this folder for the remainder of this guide.
bin/	    Contains the rails script that starts your app and can 
            contain other scripts you use to setup, update, deploy 
            or run your application.

Puma is a web server distributed with Rails by default.

By default, view templates are written in a language called 
eRuby (Embedded Ruby) which is processed by the request cycle in 
Rails before being sent to the user.

A resource is the term used for a collection of similar objects, such 
as articles

Different routes are served by different acitons which is used to
determine which routes will be served to which views and 
controllers as a controller may be approached by more than one route.
A controller is mandatory for serving requests.

A controller is simply a class that is defined to inherit 
from ApplicationController class of ruby

A .gitignore file allows git to determine which files and directories 
are to be ignored.

In rails MVC is M : model is named ActiveRecord
                V : views is named ActionView
                C : controller is named ActionController

Methods in rails's Controllers are reffered to as actions.

The working of Rails static communication process is as follows :
First an address is entered in a web Browser .The browser then checks 
in the route file as to how to handle the request that has been made 
i.e the request routed to the router which handles the request.
The request in our code base is mapped to a controller (basic 
architecture of Ruby). Which has got acions defined (actions are used
by controllers to handle the requests it receives ) 
(like => root Welcome#index defines index as an action (a method defined
 in the controller of the application)) then the action directs the 
 request into the 
 views/controller(welcome in this case)/action.extensions(index.html.erb)

The difference between DATETIME and TIMESTAMP is that DATETIME stores 
all dates from 1000 to 9999 and uses up 8 bits while TIMESTAMP 
basically stores only the number of seconds elapsed from 1970 and uses 
up 4 bits.

Various handlers used by rails are as follows : builder handler is 
used to build XML templates and 
coffee handler uses CoffeeScript to build JavaScript templates. The 
erb handler is the default handler in rails for rendering html.

The form_with helper method provides with a FormBuilder object form 
which allow us to build label, text_fields etc.

In the text render plain: params[:articles].inspect render is the 
method and the lines after that represent the parameters of the 
method (as Ruby does not use brackets for arguments to a function)

The model generated by the rails generator creates a table 
pluralizing the name of the model and the table is then mapped to 
the model(ActiveRecord) 

Migrations are Ruby classes that are designed to make it simple to
create and modify database tables.Rails uses rake commands to run
migrations, and it's possible to undo a migration after it's been
applied to your database. Migration filenames include a timestamp 
to ensure that they're processed in the order that they were created.
There are two timestamps that are used by rails, one is to track 
creation and the other is to track updation.

Public methods must be declared before private visibility in Rails.

Instance variables like name in ruby are declared as 
@name= something....

The resource key in the routes.rb file in the config folder 
automatically creates all the routes for your controller.

<% %> : This executes the ruby code inside it 
<%= %> : This prints the statement inside it
<% -%> : This disallows the line break after the expression
<%# %> : This Comments out code within brackets; not sent to 
client (as opposed to HTML comments).

If you want to link to an action in the same controller, 
you don't need to specify the :controller option, as Rails will use 
the current controller by default.

Use the following code for running some functions by default(following DRY) :
  before_action : function , only : [:show , :edit , :update]
  The above method (function) will run automatically before the 
  actions defined by the only key

The render 'new' (render) method is used so that the object 
(currently in use) is passed back to the new template when it is rendered. 

pluralize is a rails helper that takes a number and a string as its 
arguments. If the number is greater than one, the string will be 
automatically pluralized.

Rails automatically wraps fields that contain an error with a div with 
class field_with_errors. You can define a css rule to make them standout.

PATCH HTTP method which is the HTTP method you're expected to use to
update resources according to the REST protocol.

The arguments to form_with could be model objects, say, model: @article 
which would cause the helper to fill in the form with the fields of 
the object. Passing in a symbol scope (scope: :article) just creates the
fields but without anything filled into them.

It is not necessary to pass all the attributes to update. For example, 
if @article.update(title: 'A new title') was called, Rails would only 
update the title attribute, leaving all other attributes untouched.

By convention, partial files are prefixed with an underscore.

The method: :delete and data: { confirm: 'Are you sure?' } options 
are used as HTML5 attributes so that when the link is clicked, Rails
will first show a confirm dialog to the user, and then submit the link 
with method delete. This is done via the JavaScript file rails-ujs which
is automatically included in your application's layout (app/views/layouts/application.html.erb) 
when you generated the application. Without this file, the confirmation 
dialog box won't appear.

the bookmarked Rails Routes page

The (:references) keyword used in the bash command is a special data type for models.
It creates a new column on your database table with the provided model name appended 
with an _id that can hold integer values.
